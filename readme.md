# SOLID-Kata

Design and implement a deck of playing cards (including jokers) using SOLID design principles.  Optimization and pattern usage are secondary objectives.  Implementation must include unit tests.

Create (and share) a repository in your private Bitbucket space.

This is an individual exercise.  Youâ€™ll get out of it what you put into it.

## Commands

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit // Runs the tests
php index.php // brings up an interactive REPL to tinker with the code
```
